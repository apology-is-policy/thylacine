// The tapestryd 9P server + compositor core (Tapestry G-3; TAPESTRY.md
// section 18). Serves the /dev/tapestry tree (section 18.5, stage 0: ctl +
// surface/) over /srv + dev9p -- the ptyfs/netd native-server lineage: the
// Conn/fid table, frame extractor, dispatch, deferred replies, and the
// 4-site cancel discipline are the audited ptyfs shapes; the Tweft handler,
// the deferred-read tri-state, and the per-conn qid ownership gate are the
// audited netd shapes.
//
// THE I-40 PRESENT HALF (specs/tapestry_present.tla; the server half of the
// SPEC-TO-CODE map). The surface lifecycle is the spec's state machine:
//
//   WeaveFirst  = `create W H` on the surface ctl: t_dma_create_weave (the
//                 G-2 kernel-minted share-admissible subtype) + map + zero +
//                 RESOURCE_CREATE_2D + whole-weave ATTACH_BACKING
//                 (backed := TRUE, serverRef := TRUE). `armed` becomes real
//                 LAZILY at the first Tweft (weft_ensure below) -- the
//                 netd precedent; the Map guard is indifferent to when the
//                 registration happens, only that retire disarms it.
//   Reweave     = `resize W H <serial>` on the surface ctl (G-6b): the
//                 ack of a size-changing CONFIGURE mints the NEW weave
//                 generation (fresh DMA + fresh resource id) and is THE
//                 GENERATION FENCE -- the Rwrite completes only after the
//                 allocation (reply-after-alloc, R2-F5), and the conn
//                 stream is FIFO, so post-ack presents validate/blit
//                 against the new geometry. The displaced generation
//                 drains passively (never read again; its last content
//                 stays displayed) and retires at the first post-fence
//                 present (RetireDisplaced + ServerRelease) or with the
//                 surface. At most one drains (<=2 gens; busy -> E_AGAIN).
//   Map         = kernel-side (G-2): the client's SYS_WEFT_MAP claims the
//                 registered share consume-once. tapestryd never observes
//                 the claim; its Woven->Live edge rides the first present.
//   Submit/Complete = h_present: every present is handled SYNCHRONOUSLY --
//                 validate, TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D, RESOURCE_FLUSH, reply
//                 Rwrite (the client's CQE = the D1 recycle gate). The
//                 in-flight window opens and closes INSIDE one dispatch, so
//                 the in-flight present set is EMPTY at every retire
//                 decision point: the tapestry_present.tla quiesce
//                 obligation (ServerRelease's "intransfer = 0") holds BY
//                 CONSTRUCTION at stage 0. A pipelined controlq (G-6+) must
//                 implement the real drain before touching retire.
//   Complete's displayed update = scanout_take(): on a present completion,
//                 a surface with no scanout owner takes scanout (the F16
//                 switch-at-first-present-COMPLETE alignment; never before
//                 its first frame has transferred).
//   Destroy/ServerRelease = retire(): ctl `destroy`, the owning conn's
//                 teardown/Tversion reset, or the R2-F4 WEDGE. Ordering
//                 (the I-40 obligation this server EXISTS to uphold):
//                 (1) quiesce -- empty by construction, asserted above;
//                 (2) SYS_WEFT_UNSHARE (registry-removal-BEFORE-page-free;
//                     discharges the spec Map guard's wstate half -- a Tweft
//                     claim racing the retire finds nothing and fails
//                     closed; on an already-claimed share the unshare is a
//                     harmless miss);
//                 (3) scanout release (SET_SCANOUT 0 if displayed);
//                 (4) DETACH_BACKING + RESOURCE_UNREF (the GPU resource
//                     dies before its backing);
//                 (5) unmap + close the weave DMA (serverRef := FALSE; the
//                     pages free when the client's mapping ref also drops,
//                     #847 -- or when the R2-F3 kernel reaper force-reclaims
//                     an orphaned client mapping after tapestryd itself
//                     dies, the ServerDeath leg).
//
// F2 (per-session isolation): a surface is resolvable ONLY by the conn that
// minted it. Every client attaches its OWN session (open=connect on
// /srv/tapestry mints a fresh SrvConn + dev9p session per opener), so
// conn == client session; walk/readdir/open/ops all gate on owner_conn +
// the per-slot generation (the netd net-3d slot-reuse discipline). Procs
// that deliberately SHARE one session (fd inheritance, or ops through the
// shared /dev/tapestry boot mount) share its surfaces -- the Plan 9
// shared-mount semantic, capability-coherent (the session IS the
// capability).
//
// F9 (caps): MAX_SURFACES_PER_CONN + the dimension bound (<= display) at
// create. R2-F4 (never-drop set): FRAME coalesces/drops; a non-droppable
// event overflowing the bounded queue WEDGES the surface (force-retire +
// CLOSE), never blocks and never drops a control event for a live client.
