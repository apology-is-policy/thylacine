# 132 — The Larder (guest-side 9P FS cache)

**Status:** L1c + L1d + L1e LANDED — the substrate + the **attr** sub-cache (L1c),
the **dentry** sub-cache incl. negative entries (L1d), and the **page** sub-cache
(L1e). L1e also adds the load-bearing **cacheability gate** (a per-`p9_client`
`cacheable` flag proven by a successful `Twalkgetattr`) that engages the whole
Larder ONLY for a content-versioned FS — a stream/control server (netd `/net`) is
never cached. L1f (the focused audit + full SMP gate + gofmt re-measure) is next.

The Larder is the guest-side cache of FS metadata + data the guest has already
fetched over 9P, so a repeated stat/walk/read is served locally instead of
re-hunted. It is the measured top lever of the on-device `go build` (56–90% of a
build's FS ops are redundant round trips). Design scripture: `docs/LARDER-DESIGN.md`;
invariant **I-38** (ARCH §28); coherence model `specs/fs_cache.tla` (L1b).

Files: `kernel/include/thylacine/larder.h`, `kernel/larder.c`, and the
serve/populate/invalidate hooks in `kernel/dev9p.c`; embedded in `struct p9_client`
(`kernel/include/thylacine/9p_client.h`), initialized in `kernel/9p_client.c::p9_client_init`.

## Purpose

The 9P protocol round-trips every metadata op; a single-threaded build runs at
in-flight depth 1 (one serial RPC per logical FS op). The base X-check
(`stalk.c`) re-stats the resolution root ~96.8% of warm stats, and fstat/stat
redundancy is 95.6–99.5%. The Larder serves those from a local, close-to-open
coherent cache — the Plan 9 `cfs` / v9fs `cache=loose` model — keyed on a true
content-version so a hit returns exactly what a fresh RPC would.

## Public API (`kernel/include/thylacine/larder.h`)

```c
void larder_init(struct larder *l);

// Serve (Read). HIT: copy the cached attr for qid_path into *out (under the lock)
// + return true. MISS: set *seq0_out to the current gen (the populate guard) +
// return false.
bool larder_attr_serve(struct larder *l, u64 qid_path,
                       struct t_stat *out, u64 *seq0_out);

// Capture the gen for a populate site that does not serve first (walk_attrs).
// Call BEFORE the RPC.
u64  larder_gen_snapshot(struct larder *l);

// Populate (Open/Refetch). Install {attr, cvers} for qid_path IFF l->gen == seq0
// (no invalidate raced the RPC). Overwrite existing / free slot / LRU-evict.

                         u32 cvers, const struct t_stat *attr);

// Invalidate (OwnWrite). Drop qid_path's entry (if present) + bump gen (always).
void larder_attr_invalidate(struct larder *l, u64 qid_path);

// --- L1d: the dentry sub-cache ---

// Serve a whole resolver run (Read) from the dentry + attr sub-caches WITHOUT an
// RPC, under ONE lock hold. Full positive run: true, *nresolved=nname, *is_miss=0,

// sts[0..i) filled. Dentry/attr miss or too-long name: false (caller RPCs).
bool larder_walk_serve(struct larder *l, u64 base_qid_path,
                       const char *const *names, const size_t *name_lens,
                       int nname, struct t_stat *sts,

// guarded. A name > LARDER_DENTRY_NAME_MAX is not cached (no-op).
void larder_dentry_install(struct larder *l, u64 seq0, u64 parent_qid_path,
                           const char *name, size_t name_len,

// bump gen. The dentry cache's SOLE coherence mechanism (no cvers gate).

// --- L1e: the page sub-cache ---

                      u32 page_off, u32 want, u32 want_cvers,
                      u8 *out, u64 *seq0_out);

// Populate (Open/Refetch). Install (qid_path, page_index) with len bytes [0,len)
// from data (from the page's aligned start), tagged cvers, IFF gen == seq0. Lazily
// kmallocs the slot's 4 KiB buffer (a failure skips -- best-effort). len clamped.
void larder_page_install(struct larder *l, u64 seq0, u64 qid_path, u64 page_index,
                         u32 cvers, const u8 *data, u32 len);

// Invalidate (OwnWrite). Drop EVERY cached page of qid_path + bump gen. Buffers
// are retained for reuse.
void larder_page_invalidate(struct larder *l, u64 qid_path);

// Free every lazily-allocated page buffer (called from p9_client_destroy).
void larder_destroy(struct larder *l);
```

All are NULL-defensive (a NULL Larder is a miss / no-op). `larder_attr_serve`,
`larder_walk_serve`, and `larder_page_serve` copy their data out under the lock — a
concurrent invalidate/evict can never tear a serve or free a page mid-copy.

## Data structures

```c
#define LARDER_ATTR_ENTRIES 256u   // bounded (I-32); tunable

struct larder_attr_ent {
    u64            qid_path;   // key; root's qid.path is 0x0, so `valid` marks empty
    u32            cvers;      // content-version (qid.version == si_cvers) at fetch
    bool           valid;
    u64            lru;        // last-access sequence (LRU eviction)
    struct t_stat  attr;       // cached metadata (80 B)
};

struct larder {
    spin_lock_t             lock;       // dedicated near-leaf; never held across an RPC
    u64                     lru_clock;  // stamps ent->lru on access
    u64                     gen;        // monotonic invalidation sequence (populate guard)
    struct larder_attr_ent  attr[LARDER_ATTR_ENTRIES];
    u64 attr_hits, attr_misses, attr_installs, attr_install_skips,
        attr_invalidations, attr_evictions;   // diagnostics (hit-rate)
};
```

~26 KiB, embedded per `p9_client` (heap-only; a client already carries a 32 KiB
`out_buf`). The `valid` bit — not a `qid_path==0` sentinel — is load-bearing:
root's `qid.path` is legitimately `0x0` (`dev9p.c:130`).

## Implementation (mapping to `specs/fs_cache.tla`)

| Spec action | Impl |
|---|---|
| `Read` (serve, no re-check) | `dev9p_stat_native` calls `larder_attr_serve` first; a hit returns with no RPC. The base X-check (`stalk.c:326` → `spoor_stat_native`) and `SYS_FSTAT` are the consumers — the biggest cheap win. |
| `Open`/`Refetch` (install fresh) | `dev9p_walk_attrs` installs each walked component's `{sts[i], w->qid[i].vers}` after the `Twalkgetattr` RPC (free — attrs already fetched); `dev9p_stat_native`'s miss-populate installs after its `Tgetattr`. Both ALWAYS install from the fresh RPC (revalidate-by-overwrite). |
| `OwnWrite` (write-through invalidate) | `larder_attr_invalidate` at `dev9p_write` / `dev9p_wstat_native` (the file), `dev9p_create` (parent AND child), `dev9p_rename` (both dirs), `dev9p_unlink` (parent). |
| `Evict` (bound) | `attr_install_slot_locked` picks existing-key / free / LRU-min victim; never exceeds `LARDER_ATTR_ENTRIES`. |

**The attr serve is a `Read`, not an `Open`.** L1c serves a cached attr WITHOUT
re-checking `cvers` — that is the RPC-elision win. Coherence is not from a
serve-time compare but from (a) own-write invalidation and (b) `walk_attrs`
re-populating fresh on every resolution. `NoWrongRead` is ABSOLUTE in the
single-writer regime (Thylacine serves its own FS to one guest) precisely because
own-writes invalidate. The `cvers` compare becomes load-bearing at the L1d
dentry-serve / L1e page-serve (which skip an RPC on a version match).

### The two SMP disciplines (LARDER-DESIGN §7 — the load-bearing property)

1. **Serve/invalidate atomicity.** Both take the leaf lock; the serve copies the
   `t_stat` out under it. A serve reads a whole valid entry or misses — never a
   torn entry. The lock is a pure leaf (never held with `c->lock`; the RPCs that
   take `c->lock` run outside it), so there is no lock-order edge to `c->lock` or
   the buddy allocator.

2. **The populate GEN guard.** The spec's `Open` reads the current `cvers` and
   installs atomically; the impl reads the `cvers` via an RPC and installs later
   — a non-atomic window. If a concurrent own-write commits a higher `cvers` AND
   invalidates the entry during that window, installing the stale RPC result
   would RESURRECT a value the write's invalidate already dropped, and a later
   causal reader would serve it (unbounded staleness → an I-38/I-28 violation).
   The `gen` counter (bumped on EVERY invalidate) is captured before the RPC
   (`larder_attr_serve`'s miss out-param / `larder_gen_snapshot`) and re-checked
   at install; a populate that raced an invalidate is skipped (a harmless missed
   fill — the next access refetches). This realizes the spec's atomic `Open`.
   `gen` is global (any invalidate blocks any concurrent populate) — sound but
   over-conservative; the target workload is depth-1, so skips are effectively
   zero. A per-key `gen` is a v1.x refinement.

### The reuse hazard (create invalidates the child)

Stratum reuses freed inos (`si_cvers` is monotonic across reuse, `si_gen` bumps).
A qid.path whose file was deleted can carry a stale prior-occupant attr until that
qid.path is invalidated or overwritten. The paths to a Spoor for a reused ino:
`walk_attrs` (overwrites fresh) or `create` (Tlcreate/Tmkdir). The create path
never runs `walk_attrs`, so `dev9p_create` invalidates BOTH the parent (its
nlink/mtime/cvers changed) AND the child's new qid.path (drop any stale
prior-occupant attr). Without the child-invalidate, the base X-check on a
recreated dir served the deleted file's attr — the `stalk-2` E2E
delete+recreate+create-in-it failure, guarded by `dev9p.create_invalidates_reused_child`.

`unlink`/`rename` do not invalidate the child (they operate by name — the child's
qid.path is not in hand without an extra RPC); this leaves a minor stale-nlink on
an unlink-then-fstat-of-an-open-fd (the v9fs `cache=loose` residual). Any REUSE of
the freed ino is still closed — it goes through `create` (invalidated) or
`walk_attrs` (overwritten).

## The dentry sub-cache (L1d)

```c
#define LARDER_DENTRY_ENTRIES  256u
#define LARDER_DENTRY_NAME_MAX 88u   // a longer component is not cached (fail-safe)

struct larder_dentry_ent {
    u64  parent_qid_path;   // key part 1
    u64  child_qid_path;    // resolved child (positive only; 0 when negative)
    u32  name_len;          // key part 2: name[0..name_len)
    bool valid;
    bool negative;          // true: (parent,name) -> ENOENT (no child)
    u64  lru;
    char name[LARDER_DENTRY_NAME_MAX];   // the component (NOT NUL-terminated)
};
```

The dentry cache maps `(parent-qid.path, name) → child`, **including negative
entries** (`… → ENOENT`, the failed-lookup-storm win). It stores only the linkage:
a positive dentry's reply attr for the walk is served from the **attr** sub-cache
(the child's qid.path keys it), so there is no attr duplication.

**Coherence = own-write invalidation, NOT a cvers gate (the L1d ground-truth
correction).** Unlike an attr or a page — each validated by its own file's
`cvers` — a name→child binding is a fact about the PARENT directory's dirent set,
and Stratum surfaces no directory-content version that tracks a dirent change.
Verified in the Stratum tree (`src/fs/fs.c`): a child **create**
(`stm_fs_create_file`) and **unlink** (`fs_unlink_inode_and_dirent`) touch only
the separate dirent index — the parent inode is never `stm_inode_set`, so the
parent's `si_cvers` does **not** bump (only **rename** stamps the parents' mtime,
`fs.c:5507`). A parent-`cvers` compare would therefore FALSELY MATCH a stale
negative dentry after a create (serve `ENOENT` for a now-existing file). So the
dentry cache's sole coherence mechanism is dropping a directory's cached dentries
on every guest **create / rename / unlink** in it (`larder_dentry_invalidate_parent`
at `dev9p_create` / `dev9p_rename` [both dirs] / `dev9p_unlink`; the guest holds
the parent's qid.path at each site). This maps onto `fs_cache.tla`'s `Read` +
`OwnWrite` single-writer subset (`NoWrongRead` absolute) — exactly the attr
sub-cache's discipline, keyed by `(parent,name)`. No `Open` gate for dentries.

**Serve mechanics (`larder_walk_serve` at `dev9p_walk_attrs`, before the RPC).**
The whole resolver run is served from cache under ONE lock hold (an atomic
snapshot): chain `(base, name₀) → child₀`, `(child₀, name₁) → child₁`, …; each
positive hop fills `sts[i]` from the attr sub-cache (an attr miss bails the serve
to the RPC), and the next hop's parent is the resolved child. A negative hop is
the walk's miss (`*nresolved = i`, `*is_miss = 1`). The caller (`dev9p_walk_attrs`)
skips the RPC for a **full positive run only in the query form** (`nc == NULL` —
`SYS_STAT`'s final run; no server fid to bind) and for a **cached miss in either
form** (a miss binds nothing); a bind-form full walk still RPCs to bind the fid,
then re-populates. The dentry cache holds the raw dev9p-tree bindings
(Territory-independent — `walk_attrs` walks the 9P server, not the per-Proc mount
overlay), so the resolver applies the mount view to the served qids exactly as to
an RPC reply, and a negative dentry can never be a mount point (a mount point must
exist in the underlying tree). The resolver re-applies the per-component X-check
on the served prefix, so a negative serve preserves the fail-ordering (an
X-denial on an ancestor masks the miss).

**Populate.** `dev9p_walk_attrs` installs a positive dentry per walked component
(the parent is the base for hop 0, else the previous component) and, on a partial
walk (`nwqid < nname`) or a first-component `Rlerror ENOENT`, a negative dentry at
the miss. All gen-guarded by the same pre-RPC `wga_seq0` snapshot as the attr
populate. NEVER from a readdir qid (the L1a-2 rule).

## The page sub-cache (L1e)

`(qid.path, page_index) → { bytes[0..valid_len), cvers }`, a 512-slot LRU table
(`LARDER_PAGE_ENTRIES`; ~2 MiB of heap at capacity). The slot metadata is inline in
`struct larder`; each slot's 4 KiB buffer is a **lazily-kmalloc'd heap page**,
reused across evictions, freed only at `larder_destroy` (from `p9_client_destroy`).
Maps to `fs_cache.tla`'s `Read` + `Open` + `OwnWrite` on content tokens — **no spec
extension** (a page is a content token like an attr).

**The cacheability gate (§3.3, the load-bearing L1e addition).** The page cache
caches file CONTENT, so it engages ONLY for a `cacheable` client (`p9_client.cacheable`
— latched true by a successful `Twalkgetattr`, the v1.0 proxy for a
content-versioned, offset-stable FS). `dev9p_read` gates serve *and* populate on it,
so a stream server (netd `/net` — consuming reads, `qid.version` 0) is never
page-cached (an offset re-read would serve stale stream bytes). Fail-safe (default
false, settled before the first read); it also gates `dev9p_stat_native` (closing
the latent L1c netd-attr gap).

**Serve.** `dev9p_read` computes `page_index = off / 4096`, `page_off = off % 4096`,
and serves the one page if it exists, `cvers == c->qid.vers` (the reader fid's
version — the close-to-open `Open` gate; catches a cross-open external write), and
`page_off < valid_len`. A hit copies `min(want, valid_len - page_off)` bytes under
the lock and returns that count — a short serve is a legal short read the caller
loops on (one-page-per-call bounds the ≤ 4 KiB copy under the leaf lock). A partial
(small-file / EOF) page serves only within `[0, valid_len)` and misses beyond (the
caller's next read refetches), so **no EOF determination is needed**.

**Populate.** After the read RPC, `dev9p_read` installs each page the read covered
**from its aligned start** (`page_start ∈ [offset, offset+got)`), so every cached
page holds `[0, valid_len)` with no hole; an unaligned read's partial-front page is
skipped. `cvers = c->qid.vers`; gen-guarded by the `seq0` snapshot from the serve
miss (skips a fill that raced an own-write — the resurrection close).

**Invalidate.** `dev9p_write` drops every cached page of the file
(`larder_page_invalidate` by `qid.path`) + bumps gen, so the guest sees its own
write strongly. (A whole-file drop, not per-range — sound; a precise invalidate is
a v1.x tuning.)

**Page-buffer lifetime (SMP).** A serve copies OUT under the lock; an evict / reuse
/ invalidate / destroy runs UNDER the lock; a slot's buffer is never freed on evict
(only reused or freed at destroy), so a concurrent serve can never read a freed
buffer. `kmalloc(4096)` is non-blocking (buddy `zone->lock`, a leaf below the leaf
`l->lock` — the **`l->lock → buddy` order**), so the lazy alloc is safe under the
lock (LARDER-DESIGN §7 anticipated this order).

## State / coherence properties

- **Own-write happens-before a later read → the read sees the write.** The
  invalidate is part of `dev9p_write`/etc.'s completion (before it returns), so
  any read that starts after the write returns misses → refetches fresh. A read
  CONCURRENT with the write is an unsynchronized application race (POSIX allows
  either value).
- **Base X-check bounded staleness (I-28).** A tightened dir permission via the
  guest's own `chmod` invalidates immediately (`dev9p_wstat_native`); an
  out-of-band tighten is bounded by the next `walk_attrs` revalidation. This is
  the accepted unsynchronized-snapshot TOCTOU the resolver already carries (§4).

## Tests

- `kernel/test/test_larder.c` (attr) — `larder.install_serve` / `serve_miss` /
  `invalidate` / `gen_guard` (the resurrection close) / `root_qid_zero` /
  `overwrite_wins` / `eviction_bounded` (I-32).
- `kernel/test/test_larder.c` (dentry, L1d) — `larder.dentry_serve` /
  `dentry_serve_miss` / `dentry_negative` / `dentry_multi_hop` /
  `dentry_partial_chain_bails` / `dentry_attr_miss_bails` /
  `dentry_invalidate_parent` (the ground-truth core: own-write invalidation drops
  a stale negative) / `dentry_gen_guard` / `dentry_name_too_long` /
  `dentry_bounded`.
- `kernel/test/test_dev9p.c::test_dev9p_create_invalidates_reused_child` — the
  L1c create-reuse attr regression (non-vacuous: `1054/1055 FAIL` with the
  child-invalidate reverted).
- `kernel/test/test_dev9p.c::test_dev9p_create_invalidates_negative_dentry` — the
  L1d create→dentry-invalidate hook regression (non-vacuous: FAILs with the
  `larder_dentry_invalidate_parent` call reverted). `test_dev9p_walk_attrs` resets
  the Larder between its wire sub-tests (they flip the wire result for one path
  without a mutation — non-physical for single-writer — so the cache would
  otherwise serve a stale entry).
- `kernel/test/test_larder.c` (page, L1e) — `larder.page_serve` (bytes verbatim) /
  `page_serve_miss` (gen handed back) / `page_offset` (page_off + want) /
  `page_cvers_mismatch` (the Open gate) / `page_partial` (serve within valid_len,
  miss beyond) / `page_invalidate` (OwnWrite drops all pages + bumps gen) /
  `page_gen_guard` (the resurrection close) / `page_overwrite` (buffer reused) /
  `page_bounded` (I-32) / `page_destroy_frees`.
- `kernel/test/test_dev9p.c::test_dev9p_page_cache_serve_and_gate` — the L1e
  integration proof (non-vacuous: `1076/1077 FAIL` with the `dev9p_read` serve
  disabled): a cacheable client's re-read is served with NO second Tread (the
  sentinel-offset trick reuses the loopback's Tread-offset capture as a
  "was a Tread sent?" probe), a non-cacheable client's re-read RPCs (the gate), and
  an own-write invalidates the page.
- In-guest: `stalk-2` cross-mount E2E (the delete+recreate+create-in-it sequence),
  `fs-mut-smoke`, `probe46` (fstat). 1077/1077 + boot OK + reduced SMP gate 20/20
  (default+ubsan-smp4, 0 corruption).

## Error paths

None user-visible: a cache miss falls through to the real RPC; an OOM cannot occur
(the array is inline, fixed); a NULL Larder degrades to always-miss. A gen-guard
skip is a missed fill, not an error.

## Performance

L1c targets the base X-check re-stat storm + fstat redundancy (~1/3 of warm ops;
"a one-entry cache of root's attr alone kills ~1/3 of warm ops"). The full gofmt
cold/warm re-measure vs the LARDER-DESIGN §10 predictions lands at L1f (after the
dentry + page sub-caches). The `attr_*` diagnostics counters expose the hit rate.

## Known caveats / footguns

- **v1.0 is single-writer-sound** (own-write invalidation; the accepted
  close-to-open window for an out-of-band writer). Writeback / persistent /
  cross-session / readdir caching are v1.x seams (LARDER-DESIGN §11).
- **qid.path keys, not full ino** (R92 P3-3): `qid_path` truncates ino to 32 bits,
  so a low-32 ino alias shares a cache key — infeasible at v1.0 (no pool has 4 B
  inodes), documented as the v2.0-ino-cap bound.
- **Never populate from a readdir qid** (the L1a-2 audit-F1 rule): Rreaddir's
  `qid.version` is a link-time `si_gen` snapshot, not `si_cvers`. L1c populates
  only from getattr/walk_attrs; `dev9p_readdir` has no populate.
- **The Larder engages only for a `cacheable` client (the L1e gate).** A
  per-`p9_client` `cacheable` flag (default false) latches true on the first
  successful `Twalkgetattr` (POUNCE) — the v1.0 proxy for a content-versioned,
  offset-stable FS. `dev9p_stat_native` (attr) and `dev9p_read` (page) gate serve
  *and* populate on it; the dentry `walk_serve` is additionally guarded by the
  `wga_unsupported` latch. A stream/control server (netd `/net` — consuming reads,
  `qid.version` 0) answers `Twalkgetattr` ENOSYS and never latches, so it is never
  cached (no stale stream bytes, no out-of-band-mutated stale attr). This closed
  the latent L1c gap (attr caching previously had no server gate). netd is the only
  non-Stratum dev9p client at v1.0; corvus is a byte-mode SrvConn (no Larder);
  `/proc` `/ctl` `/env` `/dev` are native kernel Devs (no dev9p, no Larder). The
  POUNCE-support proxy is not identical to the true property (a future POUNCE-but-
  streaming server, or a content-versioned FS without POUNCE, needs an explicit
  attach-time capability — a v1.x add); it is fail-safe (unproven → not cached).
- **The Loom async path bypasses the Larder (L1c/L1d seam).** The Larder is
  populated + invalidated only on the SYNCHRONOUS dev9p path. The Loom async
  engine (`kernel/loom.c` — `LOOM_OP_WRITE` / `MKNOD` / `SYMLINK` / `LINK` /
  `UNLINKAT` / `RENAMEAT`) drives `p9_client_*` directly and touches neither
  sub-cache, so a client mixing Loom FS *mutations* with synchronous *resolution*
  on the SAME mount is a second (out-of-band) writer from the Larder's view: a
  Loom write can leave a stale attr, a Loom dirent-mutation a stale dentry,
  bounded by the next own-sync mutation or LRU. Unreachable at v1.0 (no consumer
  mixes them). The v1.x fix invalidates from the Loom completion path. See
  LARDER-DESIGN §11.
- **The Stratum parent-mtime gap (tracked, not a Larder bug).** A child
  create/unlink does not update the parent directory's mtime/ctime in Stratum
  (only rename does) — a latent POSIX-compliance gap. It does not affect L1d
  soundness (own-write invalidation is independent of the parent `cvers`), and
  fixing it has a create-path COW cost; a v1.x tradeoff.
