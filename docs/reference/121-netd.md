# 121 — netd: the network daemon (NET-DESIGN.md, the #68 charter)

## Purpose

`netd` (`usr/netd`) owns the NIC and runs the TCP/IP stack. It is the network
arc's central Proc: the Menagerie [warden](119-warden.md) binds it **narrowed**
to the `virtio-pci:1` function's I-34 allowance (the PCI `(bus,dev,fn)` + the
wired INTID + a DMA pool — nothing else), and netd claims the device, drives the
[virtio-net-pci transport](114-netdev.md), and embeds [smoltcp](#the-smoltcp-stack)
as its stack. From net-2b it also serves `/net` as a 9P server (the Plan 9
`/net`-via-`netd` model — NET-DESIGN.md §2).

**Why netd is the NIC owner, not a separate stack Proc.** The NIC handles
(`KObj_PCI`/`KObj_IRQ`/`KObj_DMA`) are non-transferable (**I-5**), so the Proc
that *claims* the device is the Proc that must *run* the stack — a driver cannot
hand its device to a peer. This reconciles the charter's "joey spawns netd" with
the Menagerie warden-binds-narrowed model: netd is simply `netdev-pci-driver`
(the 6b-3 ARP-proof demo) evolved into the daemon, conferred exactly the NIC and
nothing more. The narrowing *is* the I-34 allowance; netd holds the live
I-34-on-PCI proof.

## The warden bind

The warden's compiled-in manifest (`usr/warden/src/main.rs::BUILTIN_MANIFESTS`):

```
driver "netd" {
    abi   = 1
    binds = ["virtio-pci:1"]      # the virtio-net PCI function (devpci-discovered)
    needs {
        pci = "node"              # the (bus,dev,fn) — claimed via SYS_PCI_CLAIM
        irq = "node:interrupts"   # the swizzled INTx INTID
        dma = "pool: 64 KiB"      # the ring + frame pools (4 KiB ring + 2×32 KiB)
    }
    serves    = "/net"            # the 9P /net tree (served from net-2b-2)
    restart   = on-crash
    lifecycle = persistent        # a standing service -- the warden leaves it running
}
```

There is **no `mmio` axis**: a PCI function's registers live in its BARs, mapped
through `SYS_PCI_MAP_BAR` off the claimed `KObj_PCI`, not through an MMIO
allowance window. The warden confers this allowance + `CAP_HW_CREATE` + a grant
descriptor (argv[1]); netd's `probe` re-checks the conferred identity is exactly
`virtio-pci:1` and fails closed on a mis-bind before touching hardware.

## The driver shape (`impl libdriver::Driver`)

netd is a [libdriver](118-libdriver.md) `Driver`, so it slots into the warden's
spawn/grant/readiness protocol identically to every other bound driver:

- **`probe(grant)`** — verify `DeviceId::parse(grant.compatible) == VirtioPci(1)`,
  then `VirtioNetPci::open()` (claim the function, map BARs, run the VIRTIO 1.2
  modern-PCI init, arm the device). A non-net grant or an open failure → `Err`.
- **`serve(self, grant)`** — own the device and run the stack. It brings the link
  up (the DHCP proof, below), then — since net-2b-1 — signals `READY` and stays
  resident in a stack-poll loop (the warden's `lifecycle = persistent` leaves it
  running). net-2b-2 turns that loop into the 9P `/net` serve loop.

Diagnostics go to the **console** (`t_putstr`): a warden-spawned driver's stderr
is `/dev/null`. netd is a **persistent** service, so it signals bring-up success
with a `READY` line on stdout (the warden's readiness pipe) and then stays
resident — the long-lived-service contract, as opposed to a one-shot that signals
completion by **exiting**.

## The smoltcp stack

[smoltcp](https://docs.rs/smoltcp) `0.12.0` is the embedded TCP/IP stack
(NET-DESIGN.md §14) — `no_std` + `alloc`, the native libthyla-rs fit (no musl, no
pouch). The `netd` Cargo.toml pins it `default-features = false` with the minimal
feature set (`alloc`, `medium-ethernet`, `proto-ipv4`, `socket-dhcpv4` at
net-2a; `socket-tcp` etc. join as the protocol surface grows). libthyla-rs
provides everything smoltcp needs: the global allocator (`alloc::ThylaAlloc`),
the monotonic clock (`time::Instant`, mapped to `smoltcp::time::Instant`), and
the CSPRNG (`rand::fill_bytes`, seeding the interface's transaction/ISN source).

### The phy::Device over `VirtioNetPci`

`NicDevice` wraps the [netdev](114-netdev.md) `VirtioNetPci` as a smoltcp
`phy::Device`. The token pattern avoids aliasing (smoltcp's `receive` hands back
*both* an RxToken and a TxToken from one `&mut self`):

- **`NicRxToken`** OWNS its received bytes (a `Vec<u8>` copied out of the RX
  ring in `receive`) — it holds no device borrow.
- **`NicTxToken`** holds the single `&'a mut VirtioNetPci` borrow; its
  `consume(len, f)` fills a frame buffer and calls `nic.send` (back-pressure
  tolerant — `send` self-drains the TX ring and drops only if still full, which
  smoltcp recovers from by retransmit).

`capabilities()` reports `Medium::Ethernet` and `max_transmission_unit =
netdev::MAX_FRAME` (the largest L2 frame `nic.send` accepts, so smoltcp never
builds a frame the NIC drops; the derived IP MTU is `MAX_FRAME − 14 = 1500`).

## net-2a: the DHCP-lease proof

`serve` brings the link up by acquiring a DHCP lease from QEMU's slirp DHCP
server, exercising the whole lower stack end-to-end (Ethernet TX/RX over the
BAR-mapped virtqueues → ARP → UDP → the DHCP client state machine):

1. Build a smoltcp `Interface` with `Config::new(Ethernet(mac))` (the NIC MAC)
   and a CSPRNG `random_seed`.
2. Add a `dhcpv4::Socket` to a `SocketSet`.
3. A bounded **sleep-poll** loop (10 ms cadence, ~5 s cap): `iface.poll(now,
   device, sockets)` drains RX + drives egress; check `dhcp.poll()` for
   `Event::Configured`. On a lease, install the address + default route, print
   it, and **exit 0**. The loop is self-bounding (it cannot hang — the right
   shape for a one-shot boot proof; net-2b's persistent serve uses an IRQ-driven
   event loop instead).

A lease prints (the boot proof):

```
netd: up mac=[52, 54, 00, 12, 34, 57] link=true mtu=1500 -- bringing the link up (DHCP)
netd: DHCP lease addr=10.0.2.15/24 router=Some(10.0.2.2) dns=1 ip-mtu=1500
netd: PASS -- smoltcp brought the link up via the PCI NIC (DHCP)
```

On DHCP failure netd exits non-zero → the warden restarts it (bounded) then gives
up SOFT — the boot still completes. **On success** netd no longer exits: since
net-2b-1 it signals `READY` and stays resident (below).

## net-2b-1: the persistent lifecycle

net-2a's `serve` exited after the lease (a one-shot); net-2b-1 makes netd a
**resident service**. After the DHCP lease it announces success on the console,
signals `READY` on stdout, and enters a resident stack-poll loop that never
returns — keeping the link up (DHCP renew, ARP) until the Proc dies:

```
netd: PASS -- smoltcp brought the link up via the PCI NIC (DHCP)
netd: serving (persistent; /net 9P server lands at net-2b-2)
warden: netd pid=… up (READY) -> serving (persistent; left running)
```

The warden's `lifecycle = persistent` manifest field (libdriver `Lifecycle`,
[118-libdriver.md](118-libdriver.md); MENAGERIE.md §5) is what makes the warden
*leave netd running* on `READY` instead of tearing it down via `DeviceRemoved`
(the transient path the `netdev-driver` MMIO demo still exercises). The warden
drops netd's `Child` un-waited (no kill-on-drop), so netd reparents to the
orphan-adopter when the warden exits; its I-34 allowance is bound to its own Proc
(confer-at-spawn, #160), so the warden's exit neither revokes the NIC nor reaps
the daemon.

The resident loop honors smoltcp's `poll_delay` hint, clamped to `[50 ms, 1 s]`:
a floor that forecloses a 0 ms busy-spin (the #108 idle-spin class), a ceiling
that keeps netd responsive and bounds the idle-wakeup rate. With no active
sockets the hint is the DHCP renew deadline, so an idle netd wakes ~once/second.
net-2b-2 replaces this loop with the IRQ + 9P-accept multiplexed event loop.

## Data structures

| Type | Role |
|---|---|
| `NetD { nic: VirtioNetPci }` | the driver; owns the claimed device |
| `NicDevice { nic: VirtioNetPci }` | the smoltcp `phy::Device` adapter |
| `NicRxToken { frame: Vec<u8> }` | owns one received frame (no device borrow) |
| `NicTxToken<'a> { nic: &'a mut VirtioNetPci }` | the single `&mut nic` TX borrow |

## Tests

- **Boot proof** (the live path): `tools/test.sh` → the warden binds netd → the
  `netd: PASS … (DHCP)` line + lease `10.0.2.15/24` + `4 bound, 3 up` + boot OK.
- **SMP gate**: `tools/ci-smp-gate.sh` (default+UBSan × smp4/smp8) — netd is
  single-threaded over the already-gated kernel PCI/IRQ/DMA surface.
- The smoltcp glue (the phy tokens) is exercised by the live DHCP exchange;
  host-level unit tests for the fid state machine arrive with net-2c.

## Error paths

- `probe` mis-bind (identity ≠ `virtio-pci:1`) → `Err(NoMatch)` (fail-closed).
- `VirtioNetPci::open()` failure (no device / already-claimed / BAR map / no
  INTID / feature reject) → `Err(Hardware)`.
- DHCP no-lease within the poll bound → `Err(Hardware)` → warden restart → SOFT
  give-up (boot survives).

## Status

- **net-2a (LANDED)**: smoltcp embedded + the `phy::Device` over `VirtioNetPci` +
  the DHCP-lease boot proof; netd is the warden-bound `virtio-pci:1` driver
  (retiring the `netdev-pci-driver` ARP demo it subsumes). The kernel is
  byte-unchanged (pure userspace).
- **net-2b-1 (LANDED)**: the persistent lifecycle — the libdriver `Lifecycle`
  manifest field + the warden's leave-running-on-`READY` policy; netd signals
  `READY` and stays resident in the stack-poll loop. The kernel is byte-unchanged.
- **net-2b-2**: the 9P `/net` server (the corvus precedent + `libthyla_rs::ninep`)
  — posts to `/srv/net`, serves the NET-DESIGN.md §3.1 `/net` directory schema,
  joey mounts it at `/net`; the resident loop multiplexes the NIC IRQ + 9P accept.
- **net-2c**: the `/net/tcp` `clone`/`connect`/`data` client path + the §3.4 fid
  state machine (one fid ↔ one smoltcp socket; N reuse gated on clunk).
- **net-2d**: the focused audit over the netd surface + the ARCH §25.4 /
  CLAUDE.md audit-trigger enumeration + the SMP gate + close.

## Known caveats / seams

- **No 9P server until net-2b-2.** net-2b-1 makes netd resident (it holds the link
  + signals `READY`), but it does not yet post `/srv/net` or serve the `/net` tree
  — `serves = "/net"` is the declared (not-yet-realized) path. net-2b-2 lands the
  9P server + the joey mount.
- **The resident loop is sleep-poll, not IRQ-driven** (net-2b-1): it honors
  smoltcp's `poll_delay` (clamped `[50 ms, 1 s]`), idle-light but not woken
  promptly by RX. net-2b-2's serve loop integrates the NIC IRQ + the 9P accept
  poll for a properly event-driven persistent loop.
- **smoltcp owns wire-protocol correctness** (its authors spec'd it); netd's
  state machine (net-2c) wraps *a* socket abstraction, so the recorded fallback
  (a Plan 9 IP-stack port, NET-DESIGN.md §14) would not change `/net`.
