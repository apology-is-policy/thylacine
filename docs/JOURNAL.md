# The autonomous-run journal

**What this is for.** After a long autonomous run the operator needs to
reconstruct what happened without stitching together `git log`, six phase-status
rows, and a memory directory. This is that single thread: what landed, in order,
why, what it cost, and what it left open.

**What it is NOT.** Not a changelog — `git log` already has the commits, and
duplicating them here would rot. Not a status doc — `docs/phaseN-status.md` owns
per-chunk rows. What lives here is the *narrative*: the reasoning, the wrong
turns, the findings that were not in anyone's plan, and the decisions that
needed the operator.

**Conventions.**

- Newest run first. Within a run, chronological.
- Every claim carries its evidence: a hash, a measured number, a file:line.
- **A wrong turn is worth more than a win** — record the ones that were caught
  and how, because those are the reusable part.
- **Say what is still open, and be exact about what "fixed" covers.** A half a
  defect closed is written as a half.

## 2026-08-16 — Warp-C C-1, the per-slot decision, and one third of the extinction tear

Resumed from a self-compaction at the 600k checkpoint. **The nudge fix worked
on its first live test** — the detached watcher fired behind `/compact` and the
far side woke itself, which is the loop the operator had been closing by hand at
every boundary.

### Warp-C C-1 — the composed present, modelled (`ee581fbd`, fixup `ae9a25df`)

GPU-DESIGN §4.5.6 is binding here: `tapestry_present.tla` is model-first, so the
model is extended *before* the impl. Added the GPU-composed present behind
`ALLOW_COMPOSE` — `Attach`/`Detach` (P1b's authority-conferral point),
`ComposeBlit`/`ComposeComplete`, `DrainedOfBlits` on `ServerRelease` + `Free`,
and two invariants repeating T-1's own LIFETIME/CONTENT split: `NoTornCompose`
and `NoStaleCompose`. Eleven cfgs, gated by the new `specs/check-tapestry.sh`.

**The control was set before the work, which is the only reason it meant
anything.** I recorded every cfg's distinct-state count *before* touching the
module, so "this extension is additive" became checkable: with `ALLOW_COMPOSE =
FALSE` the six pre-existing cfgs must reproduce 5413 exactly. They do — and the
check earned its keep, catching that tracking `filled` unconditionally cost the
direct path 5413 → 10413 states.

**Two measurement traps, both mine, both caught by controls rather than by
reasoning:**

- My first comparison harness reported all six cfgs as DIFFERING. The harness
  was broken (`set --` inside the loop clobbered the positionals, lagging every
  expectation by one row). But under the bad labels the raw numbers still said
  something real, and chasing *that* was the right move.
- The buggy cfgs genuinely did differ — and it turned out **the metric was of
  the instrument**. A buggy cfg halts at the first violation, so with parallel
  workers "states explored before tripping" is scheduler noise: measured
  129/141/155 across three *identical* runs. Buggy cfgs are now judged on exit
  status plus the *name* of the invariant reported. (Never on TLC's prose — it
  writes both "is violated" and "was violated" depending on property kind.)

**Then TLC refuted my model, and the tree refuted the premise under it.** I had
carried the in-flight blit as the *slot* it reads, reasoning that a client
filling a *different* slot during a composition is legitimate pipelining — and I
wrote that justification into the module header as though it were established.
It is false. `usr/tapestryd/src/gpu.rs:1515-1518`: tapestryd allocates one 2D
resource per surface, attaches the whole weave as backing, and transfers at a
per-present *offset* that selects the slot. Guest-side slots buy **no** host-side
concurrency. The guard also had the shape of a known trap — `intransfer = 0` is
a gauge reading zero, equally true of "the fill landed" and "no fill was ever
issued" — now closed by an explicit `filled`.

The exclusion is symmetric, so it gets a sabotage *per direction*
(`buggy_blit_during_fill`, `buggy_fill_during_blit`) rather than one flag opening
both gates, which would only ever demonstrate whichever end TLC reached first.

Non-vacuity was measured, not assumed: coverage shows the composed actions fire
`0:0` with the switch off and `ComposeBlit` 2264 / `ComposeComplete` 7328 with it
on, so the green sits over a constructed state.

**Verification:** 32 spec modules green + the 11-cfg tapestry gate. `corvus` and
`handles` deliberately not re-run — 87 minutes, and nothing `EXTENDS`
`tapestry_present`, so they cannot be reached by this change. Zero build inputs
changed (proved by `git diff --name-only`), so the full bar's other legs carry
from `ca50a164` by construction rather than by assertion.

### The design fork it forced — and the operator's vote (`14f8c1ed`)

C-1 surfaced an obligation **the prose did not have**: the D1 recycle gate does
not survive the composed path unchanged. In the direct path a present's terminal
CQE genuinely means "the host has finished reading" — until the compositor
becomes a second, async reader of that one host resource, at which point the CQE
stops meaning the resource is free and nothing in the old rule notices.

Researched before posing it (Wayland `wl_buffer.release` + `drm_syncobj`, Android
BufferQueue acquire/release fences, Fuchsia buffer collections), which showed the
SOTA answer is *two* mechanisms, not one: buffer-release semantics for software
clients, explicit fences for GPU ones. Posed the fork with that attached.

**Operator chose one host resource per slot (3×).** Landed as a scripture commit
with no code, per the design-conversation pattern: GPU-DESIGN §4.5.8, with the
two rejected alternatives and their reasons, and the cost stated rather than
buried (3× host VRAM; ~100 MB at 4K, against a 64-MiB weave cap that already
cannot hold a triple-buffered 4K weave). The landed model does not change with
the vote — `NoStaleCompose` is whole-generation, correct today and merely
conservative once slots become distinct host objects.

### The extinction tear — one third of it (`44a8d53f`)

A surfaced soundness defect outranks the perf arc, so I stopped C-2 and took
this. The `EXTINCTION:` ABI line is emitted as four separate unlocked
`uart_puts` calls; every consumer anchors its match (`^EXTINCTION:` in
`tools/test-fault.sh`, and bare-token matchers elsewhere). A torn banner is
therefore not cosmetic — it is **a real extinction the harness cannot see**,
fail-open on the one channel the whole test discipline trusts.

**The vault already carried an adjacent seam, and I nearly conflated them.**
There are **three** tearing sources with confusingly close names:

1. extinction vs extinction — the re-entrancy guard is per-CPU *by design*, so
   two dying CPUs both print. **Fixed** (`extinction_claim_console`).
2. extinction vs a peer's *normal* console write — the vault's
   `seam-extinction-line-unserialized`. **Open.**
3. `IPI_HALT` — would subsume both. **Open**, a commented-out reservation.

The fix is one `__atomic_exchange_n`: a raw atomic rather than a kernel spinlock
(this runs on a dying machine, often inside a fault handler, and a primitive
carrying lock-order assertions could itself fault), try-once rather than spin
(the winner never releases, since every path ends in `_torpor`), and losers park
emitting nothing — because the failure modes are asymmetric: a torn line can be
read as a clean boot, a missing one leaves the guest visibly hung. Take the loud
failure.

**The fix introduces its own fail-open, and that is what most of the design
guards.** Nothing releases the console, so anything claiming it spuriously
silences every later extinction in the boot — the same defect from the other
side. Hence the deliberate interface split: the claim core is exported to be run
on a *caller-supplied* word, and nothing exports a way to claim the live one. A
test that took the real console would disable extinction reporting for every
test after it, silently.

**Both new tests were sabotage-verified** (1367/1367 → 1365/1367, each failing
on its own distinct assertion message). And the first one is documented for what
it does *not* cover: it is sequential and the property is a race, so a non-atomic
`if (*w) return 0; *w = 1; return 1;` passes it identically. Covering the real
regression needs a multi-CPU fault-injection arm with a **forced** interleaving —
without forcing it the pre-fix build garbles only sometimes, and a discriminator
that fails only sometimes is not a regression test. Tracked, not skipped quietly.

Also corrected a phantom that had propagated into two files: both
`kernel/extinction.c` and the header told readers to co-update
`tools/agent-protocol.md`, which was planned in Phase 1 and never written, and
`tools/run-vm.sh`, which matches neither literal because it only launches QEMU
and never reads boot output. Both now point at the vault's `abi-boot-banner`
mirror set instead of a transcribed list.

**Verification (the full bar, since this is a kernel change):** build clean;
suite 1367/1367 (was 1365; +2); SMP gate 40/40 with 0 corruption across
default-smp4/smp8 + ubsan-smp4/smp8; LS-CI 35/35 PASS; v8.0 floor OK.

**A killed gate is not a green gate.** The first LS-CI run was stopped by the
harness (`Terminated: 15` on its scenario subprocesses) after I ended a turn
while it ran; the SMP gate had survived the identical foreground → background
migration earlier in the same run, so what differed was ending the turn. Re-run
as a tracked background task, staying in-turn.

**And then I got the reasoning for that right conclusion wrong, twice, the same
way.** I first wrote that the killed run "recorded zero verdicts", inferring it
from a stdout log containing only `==> start:` lines. Then, waiting on the
re-run, I read the same channel and concluded it had produced no results after
eight minutes. Both readings were of the wrong channel:
`tools/test-interactive.sh` says so in its own comment — *"The verdict is a
FILE, not a counter"* — and writes results to per-slot `timings.tsv`, never to
stdout. The re-run was healthy the whole time (`go8d PASS` already on disk).

So: **a pattern that matches the wrong thing returns a confident wrong answer,
never an error** — a lesson already pinned in memory, re-learned twice in one
hour on one command. What makes it worth writing down again is that the wrong
instrument produced a *plausible* story both times (a killed gate really had
been killed; a slow gate really can be slow), which is precisely why it was not
self-correcting. The fix is to find where a tool actually writes its verdict
before reading any verdict from it.

### Before C-2 wrote a line: the composed path cannot run on the dev loop

Checked the precondition rather than assuming it, and it changed the arc. The
boot log of the very run I had just gated says
`tapestryd: gpu up -- 1280x800, pci intid=35, virgl=0 capsets=0`, and
`tools/run-vm.sh` defaults to `virtio-gpu-pci` — a device with no GL. So
`CTX_CREATE` / `RESOURCE_CREATE_3D` / `SUBMIT_3D` are unavailable on the primary
dev loop, and with them every mechanism §4.5 describes.

Three consequences, recorded as GPU-DESIGN §4.5.9. C-2/C-3 must be verified on
**thyla-pi**, not here. The composed path must be capability-gated on the
negotiated feature bit — a tapestryd that assumed GL would take the console dark
on the default device. And the third corrects the roadmap: **"C-4 retire the
readback path" cannot mean delete it.** That is forced twice over — by the plain
`virtio-gpu` that is the default here, and more fundamentally by bare metal,
where there is no virtio-gpu at all and virgl is a *virtualization* transport
with nothing to negotiate. The CPU path is the universal one; GPU composition is
the accelerated path where a GPU seam exists.

The cost is stated rather than left to be discovered: tapestryd carries **two
composition paths permanently**, and they must stay behaviourally identical from
the outside or the gate that proves one is silent about the other.

### The C-2 verification host, proven rather than assumed

Having established the dev loop *cannot* run the composed path, the next
question was whether anything can. Synced HEAD to thyla-pi (all 80 pool chunks
hash-verified, artifacts paired) and booted `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` under KVM on
real V3D:

```
tapestryd: gpu virgl -- num_scanouts=1 num_capsets=2
tapestryd: gpu capset[1] id=2 max_version=2 max_size=1384
tapestryd: gpu up -- 1280x800, pci intid=35, virgl=1 capsets=2
CAPSET GATE: VERIFIED
```

So C-2 has a working verification host, and the two figures — `virgl=0` here,
`virgl=1` there — are the whole argument for §4.5.9 in one line each. Worth
doing before the implementation rather than after: had C-2 been written first,
its first symptom on the dev loop would have been a dark console, which is a
long way from its cause.

### C-2a — the capability gate and the compositor context

The first landable piece of C-2: a reserved compositor virgl context
(`COMPOSITOR_CTX = 0x100`, far above the client `slot + 1` range so a client's
stream can never author against the screen), minted only where `virgl`
negotiated, and a startup line reporting which composition path the host can
actually take.

**The first cut reported nothing, and the boot passed anyway.** I had hung the
posture report off `ensure_screen`, beside the other display resources — but
`ensure_screen` runs only under `Scanout::Composed`, a state a normal boot never
enters, so the line sat behind an unconstructed state and printed on neither
host. The suite went 1367/1367 with the feature effectively absent. Which
composition path is *available* is a property of the HOST, fixed at feature
negotiation, so it now reports where the host is brought up.

**Verified on both arms, differing in exactly one variable** — a negative
assertion alone would have been satisfied by a broken fixture:

| Host | Negotiation | Posture |
|---|---|---|
| dev loop, `virtio-gpu-pci` | `virgl=0` | `composed path = CPU (virgl=0)` |
| thyla-pi, `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` | `virgl=1 capsets=2` | `compositor ctx 256 up` → `composed path = GPU` |

Getting the positive arm took one correction of its own: the `capset` verb
filters its output at the capset markers, so the Pi run *looked* like it lacked
the line when it had simply not been shown it — `boot-probe.sh` keeps the full
log on the host, and the line was there. A truncated capture and a missing
feature are the same reading until you check which one you have.

### C-2b — the 3D screen, landed gated and HONESTLY UNPROVEN on its own arm

The screen becomes a host-side 3D resource attached to the compositor context
where GL exists, falling back to the 2D resource everywhere else. Guest backing
stays on both paths, because at C-2b the screen is still CPU-filled — only its
host-side representation changes. `screen_push` grows a 3D arm, and there the
sync transfer moves the whole surface rather than the damage rect: a deliberate
trade, since C-3 deletes the CPU fill outright and building a rect path for a
mechanism already scheduled for removal is waste.

**What is verified, and what is not — stated because the gap is the finding.**
The FALLBACK arm is verified: suite 1367/1367, and LS-CI 35/35 where the
`ls-gfx` scenarios assert exact pixels via screendump and therefore cannot pass
without a working composed screen. **The 3D arm has never executed.**
`alloc_screen` runs only under `Scanout::Composed`, and neither the dev-loop
boot nor the Pi's `capset` boot enters it, so `screen res N 3D (compositor ctx)`
printed on neither host. `prove` produced no new boot log to grep.

So this lands **gated off on every host I could exercise** — dead on the dev
loop by capability, unproven on the Pi by opportunity — and the commit says so
rather than calling a clean boot a verification. What it needs is a Pi run that
drives a surface into composed scanout; identifying that verb is the next step,
not an afterthought. Booting green proves the gate did not fire, which is
exactly what an `if (false)` would also prove.

### Still open leaving this run

- **Warp-C C-2** — the attach verb and the per-slot host resources §4.5.8 now
  specifies.
- **Two thirds of the extinction tear** (the vault seam, `IPI_HALT`), and a
  prosecutor round owed on the landed third.
- **`main#228`** — Fable rounds on C-0d and #243, quota-blocked. Deliberately
  *not* run on an Opus fallback: what is owed there is lineage independence, and
  a fallback round would spend the surface without buying it.
